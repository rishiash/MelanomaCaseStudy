# CNN Model to detect Melanoma
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Goal is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- The following CNN models were run
	- Vanilla CNN model
	- CNN model with regularization and data augmentation
	- CNN model after resolving the class imbalance
- Dataset consisted of 2357 images of different skin cancer types - 2239 train data and 118 validation data

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- None of the models seem to accurately predict the validation set. Possible reasons for this.
	- The test data set is different from the train data
	- The images between various data sets look somewhat alike and difficult for the algorithm to differentiate
	- Model may need to be further refined as a potential next step
